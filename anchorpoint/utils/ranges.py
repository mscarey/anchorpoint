class Range:
    """
    A class representing a range from a start value to an end value.
    The start and end need not be numeric, but they must be comparable.
    A Range is immutable, but not strictly so - nevertheless, it should
    not be modified directly.

    A new Range can be constructed in several ways:

        1. From an existing `Range` object

          >>> a = Range()   # range from -infinity to +infinity (see point #4 for how "infinity" works here)
          >>> b = Range(a)  # copy of a

        2. From a string, in the format "[start, end)".

          Both '()' (exclusive) and '[]' (inclusive) are valid brackets,
          and `start` and `end` must be able to be parsed as floats.
          Brackets must be present (a ValueError will be raised if they aren't).

          Also, the condition `start <= end` must be True.

          If constructing a Range from a string, then the keyword arguments
          `include_start` and `include_end` will be ignored.

          >>> c = Range("(-3, 5.5)")  # Infers include_start and include_end to both be false
          >>> d = Range("[-3, 5.5)")  # Infers include_start to be true, include_end to be false

        3. From two positional arguments representing `start` and `end`.
          `start` and `end` may be anything so long as the condition
          `start <= end` is True and does not error. Both `start` and
          `end` must be given together as positional arguments; if only
          one is given, then the program will try to consider it as an
          iterable.

          >>> e = Range(3, 5)
          >>> f = Range(3, 5, include_start=False, include_end=True)
          >>> e
          Range[3, 5)
          >>> f
          Range(3, 5]

        4. From the keyword arguments `start` and/or `end`. `start` and `end`
          may be anything so long as the condition `start <= end` is True and
          does not error. If not provided, `start` is set to -infinity by
          default, and `end` is set to +infinity by default. If any of the
          other methods are used to provide start and end values for the Range,
          then these keywords will be ignored.

          >>> g = Range(start=3, end=5)  # [3, 5)
          >>> h = Range(start=3)  # [3, inf)
          >>> i = Range(end=5)  # [-inf, 5)
          >>> j = Range(start=3, end=5, include_start=False, include_end=True)  # (3, 5]

          You can also use the default infinite bounds with other types:

          >>> k = Range(start=datetime.date(1969, 10, 5))  # [1969-10-05, inf)   includes any date after 5/10/1969
          >>> l = Range(end="ni", include_end=True)  # [-inf, ni)   all strings lexicographically less than 'ni'

        When constructing a Range in any way other than via a string,
        non-numeric values may be used as arguments. This includes dates:

        >>> import datetime
        >>> m = Range(datetime.date(1478, 11, 1), datetime.date(1834, 7, 15))
        >>> print(datetime.date(1492, 8, 3) in m)  # True
        >>> print(datetime.date(1979, 8, 17) in m)  # False

        and strings (using lexicographic comparisons):

        >>> n = Range("killer", "rabbit")
        >>> print("grenade" in n)  # False
        >>> print("pin" in n)  # True
        >>> print("three" in n)  # False

        or any other comparable type.

        By default, the start of a range (`include_start`) will be inclusive,
        and the end of a range (`include_end`) will be exclusive. User-given
        values for `include_start` and `include_end` will override these
        defaults.

        The Range data structure uses a special notion of "infinity" that works
        with all types, not just numeric ones. This allows for endless ranges
        in datatypes that do not provide their own notions of infinity, such
        as datetimes. Be warned that a range constructed without arguments will
        then contain every value that can possibly be contained in a Range:

        >>> q = Range(include_end=True)
        >>> print(q)  # [-inf, inf]
        >>> print(0 in q)  # True
        >>> print(1 in q)  # True
        >>> print(-99e99 in q)  # True
        >>> print("one" in q)  # True
        >>> print(datetime.date(1975, 3, 14) in q)  # True
        >>> print(None in q)  # True

        Although, for numeric types, infinity automatically conforms to the
        mathematical infinity of IEEE 754:

        >>> print(float('nan') in q)  # False

        Mathematically, infinity and negative infinity would always be
        exclusive. However, since they are defined values in the floating-
        point standard, they follow the same rules here as any other value,
        with regard to inclusivity or exclusivity in Range objects:

        >>> r = Range(include_start=True, include_end=False)
        >>> print(r)  # [-inf, inf)
        >>> print(float('-inf') in r)  # True
        >>> print(float('inf') in r)  # False

        The Range class is hashable, meaning it can be used as the key in a
        `dict`.

class RangeSet(Iterable):
    """
    A class to represent a mutable set of Ranges that may or may not overlap.
    A RangeSet will generally interface cleanly with a Range or another
    RangeSet. In general, most methods called on a RangeSet will try to
    coerce its argument to a RangeSet if it isn't one already (so, a
    list of Ranges is a valid argument for many methods).

    A RangeSet can be constructed from any number of Range-like objects
    or iterables containing Range-like objects, all given as positional
    arguments. Any iterables will be flattened by one later before having
    their contents added to this RangeSet.

    Examples of valid RangeSets include:

    >>> a = RangeSet()  # empty RangeSet
    >>> b = RangeSet([Range(0, 1), Range(2, 3), Range(4, 5)])  # single iterable as a positional argument
    >>> c = RangeSet(Range(0, 1), Range(2, 3), Range(4, 5))   # multiple Ranges as positional arguments
    >>> d = RangeSet("[0, 1)", ["[1.5, 2)", "[2.5, 3)"], "[4, 5]")  # multiple positional arguments, one is an iterable

    Nested iterables are not supported, and will raise a ValueError:

    >>> e = RangeSet([[Range(0, 1), Range(2, 3)], [Range(4, 5), Range(6, 7)]])

    Internally, Ranges are stored ordered from least to greatest.
    Overlapping ranges will be combined into a single Range. For example:

    >>> f = RangeSet("[0, 3]", "[2, 4)", "[5, 6]")
    >>> str(f) == "{[0, 4), [5, 6]}"

    All Ranges in a given RangeSet must be comparable to each other, or
    else errors may occur. The Range type is by default comparable with
    itself, but this functions by comparing the start and end values -
    if two Ranges have non-mutually-comparable start/end values, then
    they cannot be compared, which breaks this data structure's internal
    organization. This is an intentional design decision.

    RangeSets are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in dicts.

class RangeDict:
    """
    A class representing a dict-like structure where continuous ranges
    correspond to certain values. For any item given to lookup, the
    value obtained from a RangeDict will be the one corresponding to
    the first range into which the given item fits. Otherwise, RangeDict
    provides a similar interface to python's built-in dict.

    A RangeDict can be constructed in one of four ways:

    >>> # Empty
    >>> a = RangeDict()

    >>> # From an existing RangeDict object
    >>> b = RangeDict(a)

    >>> # From a dict that maps Ranges to values
    >>> c = RangeDict({
    ...     Range('a', 'h'): "First third of the lowercase alphabet",
    ...     Range('h', 'p'): "Second third of the lowercase alphabet",
    ...     Range('p', '{'): "Final third of the lowercase alphabet",
    ... })
    >>> c['brian']
    'First third of the lowercase alphabet'
    >>> c['king arthur']
    'Second third of the lowercase alphabet'
    >>> c['python']
    'Final third of the lowercase alphabet'

    >>> # From an iterable of 2-tuples, like a regular dict
    >>> d = RangeDict([
    ...     (Range('A', 'H'), "First third of the uppercase alphabet"),
    ...     (Range('H', 'P'), "Second third of the uppercase alphabet"),
    ...     (Range('P', '['), "Final third of the uppercase alphabet"),
    ... ])

    A RangeDict cannot be constructed from an arbitrary number of positional
    arguments or keyword arguments.

    RangeDicts are mutable, so new range correspondences can be added
    at any time, with Ranges or RangeSets acting like the keys in a
    normal dict/hashtable. New keys must be of type Range or RangeSet,
    or they must be able to be coerced into a RangeSet. Given
    keys are also copied before they are added to a RangeDict.

    Adding a new range that overlaps with an existing range will
    make it so that the value returned for any given number will be
    the one corresponding to the most recently-added range in which
    it was found (Ranges are compared by `start`, `include_start`, `end`,
    and `include_end` in that priority order). Order of insertion is
    important.

    The RangeDict constructor, and the `.update()` method, insert elements
    in order from the iterable they came from. As of python 3.7+, dicts
    retain the insertion order of their arguments, and iterate in that
    order - this is respected by this data structure. Other iterables,
    like lists and tuples, have order built-in. Be careful about using
    sets as arguments, since they have no guaranteed order.

    Be very careful about adding a range from -infinity to +infinity.
    If defined using the normal Range constructor without any start/end
    arguments, then that Range will by default accept any value (see
    Range's documentation for more info). However, the first non-infinite
    Range added to the RangeDict will overwrite part of the infinite Range,
    and turn it into a Range of that type only. As a result, other types
    that the infinite Range may have accepted before, will no longer work:

    >>> e = RangeDict({Range(include_end=True): "inquisition"})
    >>> print(e)  # {{[-inf, inf)}: inquisition}
    >>> print(e.get(None))  # inquisition
    >>> print(e.get(3))  # inquisition
    >>> print(e.get("holy"))  # inquisition
    >>> print(e.get("spanish"))  # inquisition
    >>>
    >>> e[Range("a", "m")] = "grail"
    >>>
    >>> print(e)  # {{[-inf, a), [m, inf)}: inquisition, {[a, m)}: grail}
    >>> print(e.get("spanish"))  # inquisition
    >>> print(e.get("holy"))  # grail
    >>> print(e.get(3))  # KeyError
    >>> print(e.get(None))  # KeyError

    In general, unless something has gone wrong, the RangeDict will not
    include any empty ranges. Values will disappear if there are not
    any keys that map to them. Adding an empty Range to the RangeDict
